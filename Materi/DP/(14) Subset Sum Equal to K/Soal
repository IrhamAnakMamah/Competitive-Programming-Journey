You are given an array/list ‘ARR’ of ‘N’ positive integers and an integer ‘K’. 
Your task is to check if there exists a subset in ‘ARR’ with a sum equal to ‘K’.

Note: Return true if there exists a subset with sum equal to ‘K’. Otherwise, return false.

For Example :
If ‘ARR’ is {1,2,3,4} and ‘K’ = 4, then there exists 2 subsets with sum = 4. These are {1,3} and {4}. Hence, return true.

Sample Input 1:
2
4 5
4 3 2 1
5 4
2 5 1 6 7
