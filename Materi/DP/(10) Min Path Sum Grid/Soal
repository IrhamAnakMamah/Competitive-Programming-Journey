Ninjaland is a country in the shape of a 2-Dimensional grid 'GRID', with 'N' rows and 'M' columns. 
Each point in the grid has some cost associated with it.

Find a path from top left i.e. (0, 0) to the bottom right i.e. 
('N' - 1, 'M' - 1) which minimizes the sum of the cost of all the numbers along the path. 
You need to tell the minimum sum of that path.
