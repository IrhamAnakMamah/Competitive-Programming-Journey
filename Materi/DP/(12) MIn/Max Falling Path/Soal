You have been given an N*M matrix filled with integer numbers, 
find the maximum sum that can be obtained from a path starting from any cell in the first row to any cell in the last row.

From a cell in a row, you can move to another cell directly below that row, or diagonally below left or right. 
So from a particular cell (row, col), we can move in three directions i.e.

Down: (row+1,col)
Down left diagonal: (row+1,col-1)
Down right diagonal: (row+1, col+1)
